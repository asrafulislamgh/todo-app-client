### ToDo App

## What i did?

# I have created all the functionlity requires.
    - You can INSERT a task and schedule time.
    - You can UPDATE the time and Task description.
    - You can DELETE an entity
    - You can tag as FINISH a particular task.

# What is SPECIAL?
    - I added an estimated time when the task should be start.
    - I implimented the project with raw MongoDB and Express. 
    - I did not take help of Mongoose, Axios or other packege so I did it in the manual way which is tougher. 
    - So If i can handle the tougher one, I can handle the easier one in an efficient way.

# I did not upload this to any clould server. So i share my ENV file so you access it easily.
